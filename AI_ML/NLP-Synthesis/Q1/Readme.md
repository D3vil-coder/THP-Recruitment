# Natural Language Processing and Synthesis 

## Q1.

So this python script basically takes text input from txt files as specified and generates an audio file from it.

I am using Google TTS since it is open source and supports multiple languages efficiently.

The script reades the text , asks user for language and generates an audio file from it.

Incase you are testing this file , make sure to install necessary dependencies and change the txt file path as per your system.

I have mentioned link to a video of me showing the demo in the answer pdf.
