# Custom Chatbot for The Humanoid Project

First I created a JSON file which is supposed to be the document for data parsing/database.

<br>JSON Uses Object Based databasing which is optimal for Team info or speicific Timeline like database

Then I created chatbot using python 

<br>This chatbot is based on GPT2 from Hugging Face

It generates a general response from internet incase data isn't in the local database
